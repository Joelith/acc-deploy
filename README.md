# acc-deploy
NPM module for Application Container Cloud Service. This is a work in progress and not complete. In theory this should package up your node application, upload it to the Oracle Storage Cloud Service, and then deploy to the Oracle Application Container Cloud. At the moment, this just creates corrupt zip files, not sure what's broken

# Usage
In the root of your node application, run:

    $ npm acc-deploy -n "Application Name"
